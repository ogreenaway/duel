# How to run locally

### Step 1: Check you have recent Node and NPM versions

`node -v`
`npm -v`

I'm using v22.15.0 and v10.9.2, but it should work with any recent version.

### Step 2: Run MongoDB locally

Set the URL to `mongodb://localhost:27017/duel`

### Step 3: Add the ten thousand json files to the /initial_data folder

I didn't want to leak your data in a public git repository, so you have to add it manually.

### Step 4: Import the data

`npm run import-data`

### Step 5: Install dependencies and run the server

- npm i
- npm start
- url: http://localhost:3000/

# Insights about the data

- Some JSON files were missing closing brackets. I decided to automatically fix them.
- All the program_ids are unique so I can't group by them
- All the user_ids are unique or null. I decided to use the IDs generated by MongoDB so that I could trust they were unique. The original IDS might be useful for external systems or tracking and so I stored in them a "legacy_user_id" field in the database but I don't use them directly
- The user_ids are unique so I can't group by them
- advocacy_programs always has a length of one but I'm writing code as if it can be any length

# Improvements

- Add HTTPS
- Add Prettier
- Could add CRUD for tasks, programs, and users
- Create API to return clean data (paginated)

# Deliberate omissions

- Authentication
